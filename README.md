# BlogFeed
Develop a personal blog website with a clean and responsive design. The website should allow users to read blog posts, search for posts by keywords, and view posts by categories.

# Requirements

Technical Requirements:
Front-end Framework: Use a modern front-end framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular for developing the website.

Responsive Design: The website should be mobile-friendly and adapt to different screen sizes.

Navigation Bar:

Include links to 'Home', 'Categories', 'About Me', and 'Contact'.
Implement a sticky navigation bar that remains at the top when scrolling.
Home Page:

Display a welcome message or a brief intro about the blog.
Show a list of recent blog posts with a title, short summary, and a thumbnail image.
Blog Posts:

Create a few mock blog posts.
Each post should have a title, content, date of publication, and an author name.
Integrate a comment section for each post (static, no backend required).
Categories Page:

List different categories (e.g., Technology, Lifestyle, Personal Development).
Allow users to click on a category and view all posts under that category.
Search Functionality:

Implement a search bar to search for blog posts by keywords.
About Me Page:

Add a brief bio and a profile picture.
Contact Page:

Include a simple contact form with fields for name, email, and message.
Note: Form submission functionality is not required, just the front-end design.
CSS Styling and Animations:

Use CSS for custom styling.
Incorporate basic animations or transitions for UI elements.
Optional: Dark/Light Mode Toggle:

Include a toggle to switch between dark and light modes.
Learning Goals:
Get comfortable with a front-end framework.
Practice responsive web design.
Implement basic JavaScript functionality (e.g., searching, toggling categories).
Feel free to adjust these requirements based on your skill level and interests. This project should provide a comprehensive exercise in front-end development, covering layout design, interactivity, and responsiveness. Good luck, and have fun coding!
